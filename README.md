 - Personal project
 - A fast-paced game in which players control a ball to pass through challenging levels. The goal is to collect objects and reach the finish point while avoiding various types of obstacles and collecting power-ups to help along the way.
 - Currently in the early stage of development and I am continuously working on it. 
 - There is still much to be done.
